## Notes:

*James:* 
Rong, will we be able to get the code up? Thumbs up
This will be the last meeting. We’ll give an update on the Wilk’s method and a KL approach. 
With this group wrapping up, there is a working group being hosted by <> and <> on privacy attacks and auditing. 60 people signed up now, about 50/50 academic and practitioners. 
Goals of the group
Review of state of the art across the literature an make open to a broader audience
Try to construct a low-level series of best practices across a range of threat models (not as focused as ours is)

*Brian:*
Is that a w3c group?

*James:*
No, OpenDP is Community DP group.  Relatedly, next TPDP, will be co-located with OpenDP next August.
OpenDP includes a lot of non-technical experts that are privacy advocates, practitioners, or safeguarders of sensitive data.
There is a slack channel to join the new working group.

Speaking of that, the target is to present findings early April. Ask for comments on the doc, for example if the threat model is poorly described. James will ping the email list if there are meaningful updates. Feel free to add your name as an author – the document reflects our collective contributions

*Graham:*
Context on the working group. To bring everyone up to speed and in full transparency. The Google team and the Anonym team both have competing priorities limiting our ability to focus on this workstream for the next quarter or 1.5 quarters. Maybe revisit in early Q3 to understand bandwidth

In the interim goal is recap progress in April. If we want to press forward between now and then, OpenDP may be the right forum

*Charlie:*
That’s accurate. Focus on 3P cookie deprecation in Chrome. Taking up a lot of collective effort. We still think this is worthwhile

One other point on deliverables for April. PReference given the audience is not super technical. Let’s spend a good chunk of time on the criteria we discussed – that is the most useful output. When we talk about output, we should position it as how they compare to the criteria. Want to avoid going deep on metrics only 3 people will understand. 

*Graham:*
That resonates with me as well. We can share we developed metrics and leave the follow up as an exercise to the reader

<scribe missed comments>

*Charlie:*
Fine to present status of ideas – how far along is the metric. Have implementation vs just an idea

*Brian:*
Does that include any kind of laymans expression of them. Why they should care and how they should apply it. Attempting an explanation for each of them may be something we shoot for

*James:*
We have a brief overview we can point to. Can throw them in an appendix. May still be technical but gives a more general summary than what people may stumble across

*Brian:*
Good to share why we decided against something. 

*James:*
Kevin, want to take a little time and go over results?

*Kevin:*
Yeah, let me share my screen

<sharing slides, gives presentations of latest results on empirical privacy measures>

Call for comments on the doc
