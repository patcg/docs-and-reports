# Private Measurement Important Dimensions for Attribution

This document serves to identify critical design dimensions the group is considering while evaluating designs for a privacy measurement API focusing on the high-level attribution measurement use-case.
Additionally, we analyze a set of key use-cases that differ based on choices made within these dimensions.

# Major dimensions

These dimensions drastically change the architecture of the API, and nature of its output. Different choices on these axes will:

* Likely lead to entirely different overall designs
* More likely lead to non-interoperable designs
* Directly impact minor dimensions

# Minor, but important dimensions

These design dimensions may critically impact some use-cases, but they do not drastically change the architecture of the API.
It is possible to consider some differences in these dimensions while maintaining interoperability.
Additionally, some of these dimensions are influenced entirely by some of the major dimensions.
